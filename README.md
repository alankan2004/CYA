## Motivation

The reason behind making this API is for my own studying. I always been interested in self-improvement, time management and effective learning, so I been practicing spaced repetition more and more to help myself learn Data Structure and Algorithms. And I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to learn building a fullstack web application and dig more into the science of spaced repetition, so I started off with building the backend first, which is the REST API you see now.
